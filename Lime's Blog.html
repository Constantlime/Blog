        <h2 id="p1"> Hello, Once again. </h2>

        <p>My father was invited to work on a project at the <a href="https://www.ualberta.ca/index.html">University of Alberta</a> a few months ago. I don't know anything else, but I know we've been packing and preparing to leave. In fact, we're leaving for Canada tommorow.</p>
        
        <p> I was born in Canada, lived there for eight years, and have memories there, so I have some experience. But leaving Pakistan will be difficult because I have the most loyal and valuable friends, and I am the best student in the section. We call ourselves <strong id="fr">"3 Weird Friends"</strong> and leaving them will be heartbreaking. We've had the best time ever, and replacing each other will be impossible. I can't forget the laughter and the trips. </p>
        
        <p><strong>But as Joseph Cambell once said:</strong> <br></p><p id="say"><em>"We must let go of the life we planned,<BR> so as to accept the one that is waiting for us".</em> </p>

        <h2 id="p2"> The Journey </h2>
        <h6>7th-December-2022, Wednesday</h6>
        
        <p>The journey took approximately 30 hours. I couldn't write before (duh), so I'm writing today.</p>
        
        <p>The day started out pretty normal, I mean, we were going to be late, but it wasn't that dramatic..... <strong>BUT THE REST WAS HORRIBLE.</strong> The flight was fine, but it was getting very tiring. I flew with Emirates, and let me tell you, it was incredible. The 15-hour Canadian air flight was becoming tedious because I had almost watched 5 different movies and had nothing else to do.
 </p>
        <p>Then we had to go get our bags, but I was so tired that I couldn't even remember my own name. We arrived at our apartment, made a few adjustments, and fell asleep.</p>
        
        <p>We'll start properly setting up later, but first we have to unpack.</p> 
        <p>Anyway if you made it till here......THANKS BRUV ✪ ω ✪</p>
